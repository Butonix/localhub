# Name

_Big Friendly Group_. Or _Big Friendly Giant_ or the [BFG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFG_%28weapon%29) of Doom lore, if you prefer. I just needed a nice, short distinctive package name. The full name of the project is **Social-BFG**. The old name of the project was _Localhub_.

# Concept

Open source, small footprint social network platform.
